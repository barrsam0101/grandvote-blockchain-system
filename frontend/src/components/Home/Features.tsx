              This is one of the top blockchain features that help to ensure
              that the technology will remain as it is, a permanent, unalterable
              network.

              Privacy issues can also be addressed on blockchain by anonymizing
              personal data and using permissions to prevent access. Information
              is stored across a network of computers rather than a single
              server, making it difficult for hackers to view data.

            <p>
              In blockchain, decentralization refers to the transfer of control
              and decision-making from a centralized entity (individual,
              organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network. That is
              what this platform tends to achieve.

            <p>
              Distributed ledgers use independent computers (referred to as
              nodes) to record, share and synchronize transactions in their
              respective electronic ledgers (instead of keeping data centralized
              as in a traditional ledger). Blockchain organizes data into
              blocks, which are chained together in an append only mode.
